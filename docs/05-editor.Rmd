# Authoring

## The `Knit` button

If you use the RStudio IDE, the `Knit` button can render R Markdown to a
**litedown** output format specified in YAML (e.g., `litedown::html_format` or
`litedown::latex_format`). Please also remember to add a top-level setting
`knit: litedown:::knit` in YAML, otherwise RStudio will use `knitr::knit()`
instead of `litedown::fuse()` to compile R Markdown.

``` yaml
---
output:
  litedown::html_format: null
  litedown::latex_format: null
knit: litedown:::knit
---
```

## Live preview

Unless it has become your muscle memory to click on the `Knit` button in
RStudio, you may try to switch to `litedown::roam()` to preview your HTML
output. It also allows you to render a document or project in a new R session by
clicking on the ↯ button at the top, which is similar to what the `Knit` button
does.

By default, the preview will automatically refresh the content after you edit
and save a file. If you prefer building the document only when you want to, you
can turn off the live preview via `litedown::roam(live = FALSE)`. In this case,
the document will be rebuilt only when you refresh the page by yourself.

In the preview mode, you can click on the ✎ button to open a plain-text file in
your editor. Code blocks in the preview mode will have line numbers
automatically added to their left. If you click on a line number, it will bring
you to the that line in the source document.

## Visual editor

Since the Markdown syntax of **litedown** can be viewed as a subset of Pandoc's
Markdown, you can use RStudio's visual Markdown editor to author documents.
Please bear in mind that most common, but not all, Markdown features are
supported.
