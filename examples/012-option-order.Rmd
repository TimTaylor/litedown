title: Custom execution order
abstract: "We analyzed `{r, order = N + 1} nrow(x)` `{r} n_cyl`-cylinder cars, with an average MPG of `{r} m`."
---

Subset the data:

```{r}
n_cyl = 8
x = subset(mtcars, cyl == n_cyl)
```

The average MPG `{r} m` is calculated from:

```{r, order = i - 1.5}
m = mean(x$mpg)
```
