Description: Render R Markdown to Markdown (without using 'knitr'), and Markdown
    to lightweight HTML/LaTeX documents with the 'commonmark' package (instead
    of Pandoc). Some missing Markdown features in 'commonmark' are also
    supported, such as raw HTML/LaTeX blocks, LaTeX math, superscripts,
    subscripts, footnotes, element attributes, appendices, and fenced 'Divs',
    but not all Pandoc's Markdown features are (or will be) supported. With
    additional JavaScript and CSS, you can also create HTML slides and articles.
    This package can be viewed as a trimmed-down version of R Markdown and
    'knitr'. It does not aim at rich Markdown features or a large variety of
    output formats (the primary formats are HTML and LaTeX).

    commonmark (>= 1.9.0),
